## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- `get_calendar` no-arg "today" now computed in America/New_York instead of
  UTC, so evening queries no longer return tomorrow's calendar (PR #4).
- API error messages now include the response body (truncated to 500 chars);
  401s add explicit `NYC_311_API_KEY` guidance (PR #4).
- One bounded retry on HTTP 429, honoring `Retry-After` (PR #4).
- Service-request numbers validated against `311-\d+` with a corrective
  error message (PR #4).

### Added

- Tag-triggered npm release automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
  and this changelog.
- Build-only CI workflow on Node 20/22 (#2).

### Changed

- README: dedicated API-key subsection (#1).

### Added
